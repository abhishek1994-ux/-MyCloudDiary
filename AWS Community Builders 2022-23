I am super thrilled and honored to be officially declared as an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Community Builder. 



The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Community Builders program offers technical resources, mentorship, and networking opportunities to AWS technical enthusiasts and emerging thought leaders who are passionate about sharing knowledge and connecting with the technical community.

What is MCT?
A Microsoft initiative that offers you a platform with all of the resources you need to gain more experience in Microsoft technologies and pass that knowledge on to anyone who is interested!

Being an MCT:
• Microsoft has authorized and #certified me to deliver #trainings
• Assist folks in becoming certified in #azure and other #microsoft products
• Gives me access to the exclusive #mct community

It enables me to join a team of the industry's best educators who provide Microsoft technology training. Additionally, it motivates me to keep improving my skills and knowledge over time.

I'd also like to express my gratitude to everyone that welcomed me, shared their experiences with me, showed me the route, and even allowed me to give my perspective. We've worked together to build trust, teamwork, and progress. Thank you, because no one could make it and succeed on their own.

Don’t hesitate to reach out for any help.
